## Points

1. Check out other libraries for image transformations
1. Libraries which run on GPU is preferrable
1. `gocv` library needs system level dependencies
1. Benchmark all the transformations and develop a table so it can be tracked
1. `opencv` python sharpen code is much faster
1. Develop a small prototype in cuda
